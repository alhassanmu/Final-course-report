Using the [2',7'-Dichlorofluorescein Diacetate (H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA)](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/C369) 

## Prepare 100 mM Potassium Buffered Saline (PBS) at a ratio of 1:9 (m/v)

Add the following  to 1L of distilled H<sub>2</sub>O, later combine 100 ml of the resulting solutions (100 mM), and then adjust the pH to 7.4 before using.

## Working solution of H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA (5 mM)

-Calculate the amount of H₂DCFDA required using its molecular weight. The molecular weight of H₂DCFDA is approximately 487.3 g/mol.

For a 5 mM solution, the amount needed per milliliter of solvent (DMSO) is:
Amount (mg)=Concentration (mM)×Molecular Weight (g/mol)×Volume (mL)

Amount (mg)=5 mM × 487.3 g/mol × 1 mL = 2.44 mg/mL  
Accurately weigh out 2.44 mg of H₂DCFDA for every 1 mL of DMSO you plan to use.

1. Weigh 2.44 mg of H₂DCFDA powder.
2. Dissolve 2.44 mg of H₂DCFDA in 1 mL of DMSO.
3. Mix well to ensure complete dissolution.
4. Protect from light and store at -20°C.

## Sample preparation and flow cytometry analysis

1.	Collect and homogenize tissues (gills/mantle) of mussels in pre-cold 100 mM Potassium Buffered Saline (PBS) at a ratio of 1:9 (m/v) using a handheld homogenizer.
2.	Centrifuge the tissue homogenates at 500x g for 20 minutes at 4°C
3.	Collect the precipitates into 1.5 ml tubes
4.	Incubate the precipitates at 37°C for 60 minutes in the 1.5 ml tubes containing 630 µl of PBS and 70 µl of H2DCFDA (0.5 mM)
5.	Detect fluorescence intensities of the samples under 485 nm excitation and 525 nm emission by a flow cytometer
6.	Normalize the ROS levels of each sample to the body weight and express it as arbitrary units per gram of body weight (AU.g-1).
