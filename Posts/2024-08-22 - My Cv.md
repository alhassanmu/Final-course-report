		- Berman-Frank Lab  
	- The Laboratory of Biological Oceanography and Aquatic Ecology, Israel.  
	- I participated in an applied environmental project (biodegradation of plastics).
	1. Grew and maintained algae cultures.  
2. •	Measured the cultures’ optical densities using plate reader and producing growth curves for them.  

**Oct. 2022-July 2023** | Internship |  
		- Blue-Green Research Lab  
		- French Associates Institute for Agriculture and Biotechnology of Drylands (FAAB),Ben-Guriou University of Negev, Israel  
		- Supervisors - Prof. Ronen Zeev and Dr. Nina Kamennaya  
	- I explored the capacity of antioxidants to curb the dissemination of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic-resistance genes in wastewater bacteria.  
	1. 	Enumerated and isolated wastewater bacteria.   
	2. 	Performed bacteria DNA and plasmid extraction and purification.  
	3. 	Performed antibiotic resistance assay using the ETEST® strips.  
	4. 	Counted viable bacterial cells and determined reactive oxygen species (ROS) production using the flow cytometry.  
	5. 	Grew algae (Bracteacoccus spp.) under conditions to produce carotenoids and harvested them. 
	
**Sept. 2021-Sept. 2022** | Research Assistant |  
		- Spanish Laboratory Complex, University for Development Studies, Ghana.  
	1. 	Isolated bacteria (E. coli, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Salmonella, Listeria, Shigella, and Lactobacillus) from various samples  
	2. 	Performed antibiotic resistance assays employing the Kirby-Bauer Disk Diffusion method.  
	3. 	Performed biochemical assays to confirm presumptive isolates.  
	4. 	Performed Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR) and agarose gel electrophoresis.  
	5. 	Performed DNA extraction and analyzed sequence results.
