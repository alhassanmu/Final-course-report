Characterization of gut microbiome in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis in response to thermal 
stress. Frontiers in Physiology, 10, 1086. [https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.01086 ](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.01086)

## **Identified research question in the scientific paper:** 
How does thermal stress influence the composition and dynamics of the gut microbiome in the mussel 
Mytilus galloprovincialis?

## **My formulated research question**
What is the impact of oil pollution on the gut microbiome in Brachidontes pharaonis if exposed to the synergistic 
impact of thermal stress and oil pollution?  

## **A narrative paragraph using the ABT framework:** 
The marine environment is facing unprecedented challenges due to anthropogenic activities, with 
rising temperatures and oil pollution emerging as significant stressors for marine organisms. Climate 
change-induced rising sea temperatures and the persistent release of hydrocarbons into marine 
ecosystems pose serious threats to marine organisms, particularly Brachidontes pharaonis. As sessile 
filter feeders, these bivalves play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem health and are particularly 
vulnerable to environmental changes since they are ectothermic and rely heavily on external sources 
of heat to regulate their body temperature. Elevated temperatures associated with global climate 
change can disrupt the physiological processes of mussels, affecting their metabolic and respiratory 
rates and altering the diversity of the microbiome present in their gut. Additionally, oil pollution, such 
as oil spills in marine waters, can severely damage its biota, disrupting marine communities and 
supporting the proliferation of opportunistic species. Several studies have reported and attributed the 
change in mussel gut microbiome composition and diversity to thermal stress. However, until now, 
only a few novel studies have investigated the combined effects of temperatures and oil pollution on 
marine organisms, such as Coryphaena hippurus, Boreogadus saida, Gadus morhua, and 
Apostichopus japonicus. To the best of my knowledge, no such work has been done to investigate the 
combined effects of elevated temperatures and oil pollution on the invasive Mediterranean mussel, 
B. pharaonis. Therefore, my research seeks to investigate what happens to the gut microbiome in B. 
pharaonis if exposed to the synergistic impact of thermal stress and oil pollution.
