## **Generating a molecular network**

I visited the website [GNPS](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-splash.jsp) and scrolled down to select molecular to basically creat molecular network. There were spaces provided to enter my job descriptions and I did. 
Slightly below, I found a space to select my input files and I brought in a public dataset "MSV000088759". I then submitted the molecular network (MN) job.
The job took a while to finish and I had a notification when it was done (Figure 1)

## **Exploring a molecular family including the neutral losses**

To explore a molecular family after the job was done, I clicked on [View All Clusters With IDs](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/result.jsp?task=2c6e45d965284f6988f54733946ff2e2&view=view_all_clusters_withID_beta#%7B%22table_sort_history%22%3A%22main.LibraryID_asc%22%7D) which provided me with all the nodes in my network. I then filtered using "LibraryID" option. I chose to explore forskolin (Figure 2).

## **Comparing the spectra of two compounds**

I compared the spectra of two compounds and added them as a figure (Figure 3).
