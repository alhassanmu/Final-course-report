# **Goals and Gantt**

## **Research question**
Is there a synergistic impact of thermal stress and oil pollution on the gut microbiome of *Brachidontes pharaonis*.

## **Testable hypothesis using ABT** 
**A:** The marine environment faces unprecedented challenges from anthropogenic activities, including 
rising temperatures and oil pollution. 

**B:** Brachidontes pharaonis, as sessile filter feeders, is vulnerable to these stressors due to its 
ectothermic nature and reliance on external heat sources for temperature regulation.

**T:** Exposure of Brachidontes pharaonis to the synergistic impact of thermal stress and oil pollution 
will result in significant alterations in the composition and diversity of its gut microbiome. 

## **Research Goals (SMART and the experimental design questions)** 
**Research goal:** Investigate the impact of combined thermal stress and oil pollution on the gut 
microbiome of Brachidontes pharaonis. 

## **Using the SMART strategy:**

**Specific:** Investigate the impact of combined thermal stress and oil pollution on the gut microbiome 
of B. pharaonis in a laboratory-controlled environment (microcosm). 

**Measurable:** Quantify changes in gut microbiome composition and diversity in response to varying 
levels of thermal stress and oil pollution exposure. 
Measure physiological responses of B. pharaonis to different combinations of thermal stress and oil 
pollution, such as metabolic rates and antioxidant defence capacity. 

**Achievable:** Collaborate with marine microbiology laboratories to access laboratory facilities, 
equipment, and expertise. 
Obtain necessary permits and ethical approvals for conducting experiments involving marine 
organisms. 

**Relevant:** Provide insights into the interactive effects of thermal stress and oil pollution on marine 
organism health, specifically focusing on the gut microbiome of B. pharaonis. 
Contribute to a better understanding of the ecological impacts of climate change and anthropogenic 
pollution on marine ecosystems. 

**Time-bound:** Conduct preliminary experiments within the first 3 months to optimize experimental 
protocols and determine appropriate stressor levels. 
Carry out the main experiment over a period of 6 months to assess the effects of thermal stress and 
oil pollution on B. pharaonis. 
Analyze data and orally present the research findings at the IAAS annual conference with the next 3 
months.
