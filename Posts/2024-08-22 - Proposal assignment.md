# **Impact of Thermal Stress on Gut Microbiome Composition and Diversity in the Mussel *Brachidontes pharaonis* (P. Fischer, 1870)**

## **Abstract**
The rapid ocean warming associated with current climate change is a major stressor to marine organisms, impacting them directly (organism physiology) or indirectly (associated microbiomes). The latter aspect has been much less studied. This research seeks to test the impact of warming on the rocky intertidal, tropical invader mussel *Brachidontes pharaonis*, which now dominates many shores in the south and eastern Mediterranean Sea. However, *B. pharaonis* suffered mass mortality in the summer of 2016, potentially due to a pathogenic response associated with heat stress. I hypothesize that elevated temperatures could disrupt physiological processes and alter microbiome diversity. This study intends to evaluate the impact of temperatures on the gut microbiome composition and diversity of *B. pharaonis* using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Adult mussels from the Levantine coast will be acclimated and subjected to chronic thermal stress with an ambient temperature control. Gut samples will be collected after 30 days, and microbiome DNA will be extracted, PCR-amplified, and sequenced. Statistical and bioinformatics analyses, including microbial diversity indices and taxonomic annotation, will assess the impact of temperature on the gut microbiome. A preliminary experiment exposed mussels to acute thermal stress at 15°C (n=3) and 30°C (n=3), with an ambient temperature control (n=4). Results revealed that elevated temperature (30°C) significantly altered the mussel’s microbiome, increasing its diversity. There was an increase in the abundance of Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, and Bacteroidota, at the expense of dominant Proteobacteria. Key microbial taxa, including *Endozoicomonas* and potentially pathogenic *Vibrio*, shifted significantly between control and treatment groups, highlighting temperature's impact on microbiome composition. This study will provide initial insights into how rising temperatures affect the microbiome of *B. pharaonis*, indicating significant impacts on microbial community structure due to thermal stress.

***Key words:*** *B. pharaonis*, thermal stress, gut microbiome, 16S rRNA gene, elevated temperature.


## **1.0 Introduction** 
The marine environment is currently facing significant threats due to human activities, including rising 
temperatures and oil pollution (Niyogi et al., 2001). These stressors particularly impact marine organisms like 
the bivalve *Brachidontes pharaonis*, which play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem health due to their 
filter-feeding nature (Pavón et al., 2022). Ectothermic animals, such as these bivalves, depend on external heat 
sources to regulate their body temperature, making them especially susceptible to temperature changes. 
Increased temperatures from climate change can disrupt their physiological processes, affecting metabolic and 
respiratory rates and altering the gut microbiome's diversity (Li et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019). 
The gut microbiome is vital for energy utilization, nutrition, and potentially host immunity in response to 
environmental changes (Li et al., 2019). Commensal microorganisms in the gut protect their host from 
pathogens by inhibiting their growth through niche competition (Kamada et al., 2013). However, under stress, 
commensal bacteria can become pathogenic (Garnier et al., 2007; Olson et al., 2014). Studies have shown that 
elevated temperatures significantly impact the gut microbiome of mussels like Mytilus galloprovincialis and 
M. coruscus, favoring the growth of opportunistic pathogens such as Vibrio, Arcobacter, and Bacteroides, 
which can increase the host's disease susceptibility (Li et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019). 
B. pharaonis is a notable invasive species with considerable ecological and economic effects. Understanding 
its gut microbiome dynamics under changing environmental conditions is essential for predicting its response 
to climate change. Previous research has focused on characterizing the gut microbiome in mussels under 
elevated temperatures, revealing that temperature is a crucial factor in determining gut microbiome 
composition (Li et al., 2019). For instance, high temperatures have been shown to reduce bacterial diversity in 
the gut of mussels and promote the growth of opportunistic pathogens (Li et al., 2018). 
Despite extensive studies on other mussel species, there is a lack of research on the gut microbiome of the 
invasive Mediterranean mussel, B. pharaonis. The proposed study aims to fill this gap by exposing *B. 
pharaonis* to nine different temperature steps over a month to simulate chronic stress and investigate 
microbiome shifts. This research will help understand how environmental factors shape microbial community 
structure and function in this invasive species, providing insights into its ecological impact and resilience to 
climate change. 

## **2.0 Research Hypothesis and Goals** 
### **2.1 Research Hypothesis** 
The research hypothesizes that elevated temperatures can disrupt physiological processes and alter the 
diversity of *B. pharaonis*’ gut microbiome supporting the proliferation of opportunistic species and leading to 
higher mortality. 

### **2.2 Research Goals** 
1. To investigate changes in the gut microbiome composition and diversity of B. pharaonis under varying 
thermal stress conditions.

2. To determine the impact of thermal stress on the abundance of specific microbial taxa within the gut
 microbiome of B. pharaonis. 

## **3.0 Research Design and Methods** 
### **3.1 Collection and Acclimation of *B. pharaonis*** 
Adult *B. pharaonis* will be collected from the Levantine coast (fig. 1A) and transported in seawater to the 
laboratory. The mussels will be reared without feeding for one week with a constant flow of filtered seawater 
at the collection site temperature. Mussels will undergo another week of acclimation in microcosm chambers 
at ambient temperature. 

## **3.2 Experimental Design and Gut Sampling** 
Mussels will be exposed to chronic thermal stress for thirty days at nine temperature gradients: 16°C, 20°C, 
24°C, 27°C, 30°C, 33°C, 35°C, 37°C, and 39°C, plus an ambient control group which will serve as the baseline. 
Each temperature will have microcosm chambers with three 300 ml jars containing three mussels each. After 
30 days, live mussels will be dissected (fig. 1D) to obtain gut samples for microbiome DNA extraction. 

## **3.3 Microbiome DNA Extraction, PCR Amplification, and Sequencing** 
About 25 mg gut samples will be cut into pieces and placed in microcentrifuge tubes. DNA will be extracted 
(fig. 1E) and checked for concentration and purity with a Nanodrop spectrophotometer. The 16S rRNA gene 
will be PCR-amplified using primers 338F and 806R with unique barcodes. PCR products will be analyzed 
with agarose gel electrophoresis and sequenced using a G300 machine. 

## **3.4 Statistical and Bioinformatics Analysis** 
Microbial diversity indices will be calculated using the Kruskal-Wallis test after normality and homogeneity 
checks with JMPTM software. The Kruskal-Wallis test will identify bacterial taxa significantly differing 
among temperature treatments (P-value < 0.05). Quality control and sequence assembly will be done using 
Trimmomatic, FLASH, and Mothur software. OTUs will be determined using Usearch with a 97% similarity 
threshold. Taxonomic annotation will be performed with an RDP classifier against the Silva 138 database. R 
software will create visualizations (histograms, heat maps, PCA plots) to analyze bacterial community 
composition. LEfSe will identify specific bacterial taxa with differential abundance in response to 
temperatures, with a log-transformed LDA score of 2 indicating significance.

 ## **4.0 Preliminary Results** 
A preliminary experiment exposed *B. pharaonis* to acute heat stress, revealing changes in the relative 
abundance of bacterial communities. Elevated temperature significantly increased Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, 
and Bacteroidota while decreasing Proteobacteria (fig. 2).

## **5.0 Significance of the Research** 
The disturbance of the gut microbiome can indicate the health status of the host. Following the mass mortality 
of *B. pharaonis* in the summer of 2016, likely due to heat stress-related pathogenic responses, this research 
aims to elucidate the impact of temperature on the microbiome dynamics of *B. pharaonis*. By integrating 
molecular biology techniques and bioinformatics tools, the study seeks to provide evidence-based management 
strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on Mediterranean intertidal ecosystems, enhancing their 
health and resilience. Additionally, as the first study to explore the impact of temperature on the microbiome 
of B. pharaonis, it will contribute valuable knowledge to the field.
