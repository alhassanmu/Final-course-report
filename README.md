Students engaged in defining scientific questions, setting research objectives, and designing independent research projects, with a strong emphasis on climate change and its impact on marine ecosystems. The course combined both theoretical and practical components, including field sampling methods, data analysis, physiological and molecular techniques, and scientific writing. By the end of the course, students were well-prepared to conduct field surveys, analyze data using advanced tools, and present figures suitable for a research paper.

## **And, But, and Therefore (ABT) Framework**

This section summarizes my application of the ABT framework in scientific research. Inspired by the study on how thermal stress affects the gut microbiome of *Mytilus galloprovincialis*, I formulated a research question to explore the combined effects of thermal stress and oil pollution on the gut microbiome of *Brachidontes pharaonis*. My research aims to fill a gap in the current understanding of how these environmental stressors interact and impact marine organisms, particularly invasive species like *B. pharaonis*.

## **Research Goals and Timeline**

This section outlines the research objectives and timeline for studying the impact of combined thermal stress and oil pollution on the gut microbiome of *Brachidontes pharaonis*. The research is guided by the SMART strategy, ensuring that goals are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. The primary goal is to investigate the effects of these stressors in a controlled laboratory environment, with a focus on quantifying changes in gut microbiome composition and physiological responses of *B. pharaonis*. The research is planned to unfold over a year, beginning with preliminary experiments to optimize protocols, followed by the main experiment, data analysis, and presentation of findings at a conference.

## **Impact of Thermal Stress on Gut Microbiome Composition in *Brachidontes pharaonis***

This research investigates how elevated temperatures affect the gut microbiome composition and diversity in the invasive Mediterranean mussel, *Brachidontes pharaonis*. Utilizing 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the study examines the changes in microbial communities under chronic thermal stress. Preliminary results indicate that elevated temperatures significantly alter the microbiome, increasing diversity and favoring the proliferation of certain bacterial taxa, such as Firmicutes and Cyanobacteria, while reducing Proteobacteria. This research provides crucial insights into the impact of climate change on marine ecosystems and the health of *B. pharaonis*.

## **Protocols for Assessing Lipid Peroxidation and Microbiome DNA Analysis in *Brachidontes pharaonis***

This section details the protocols used to assess lipid peroxidation and conduct microbiome DNA analysis in *Brachidontes pharaonis*. The lipid peroxidation assay involves quantifying malondialdehyde (MDA) content using spectrophotometry after tissue homogenization and chemical reaction with thiobarbituric acid (TBA). For microbiome analysis, DNA is extracted from gut samples using the DNeasy® Blood & Tissue Kit, followed by 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. The final sequencing is performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform, enabling comprehensive analysis of the gut microbiome composition.

## **Preparation of Reagents and Sample Analysis for ROS Detection in *Brachidontes pharaonis***

This section outlines the preparation of key reagents and the protocol for reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection using flow cytometry in *Brachidontes pharaonis*. A 100 mM Potassium Buffered Saline (PBS) solution is prepared by combining specific amounts of KCl, KH₂PO₄, and K₂HPO₄, and adjusting the pH to 7.4. For the ROS assay, a 5 mM working solution of H₂DCFDA is prepared by dissolving 2.44 mg of the compound in 1 mL of DMSO. Tissue samples are homogenized in PBS, centrifuged, and incubated with H₂DCFDA before fluorescence intensities are measured using a flow cytometer. The ROS levels are normalized to body weight and expressed as arbitrary units per gram of body weight (AU.g⁻¹).

## **Hands-on Learning: Marine Research Methods at the Morris Khan Marine Research Station (MKMRS)**

On May 23, 2024, the research methods course led by Professor Tali Mass and Dr. Tal Luzzatto Knaan took participants to the MKMRS for a field trip. The activities included identifying marine intertidal organisms, mainly algae, snorkeling to depths of 2 meters and above, and collecting marine samples. The dominant species of algae found included *Padina*, *Ulva*, and *Jania*. We, the students, gained hands-on experience in quantifying algae coverage using transects and quadrats. We monitored sea surface temperature and seawater temperature using two HOBOconnect devices. Two samples of *Padina* algae were collected from high-light and low-light environments for physiological studies. The samples were exposed to light intensities and measured for photosynthetic electron transport rate.

## **How to Interpret qPCR Data and its Analysis**

In this section, we learned how to analyze qPCR data and interpret the resulting outcome. 

The Delta-Delta Ct (ΔΔCt) method is a statistical analysis technique used to compare gene expression levels between different samples in quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). It involves determining the cycle threshold (Ct) value for each sample, normalizing the Ct values to a reference gene, comparing the ΔCt values between samples, and calculating the relative expression level (fold change) of the target gene in the experimental sample compared to the control sample. The method assumes that the PCR efficiencies of the target and reference genes are approximately equal and that the reference gene is stably expressed across all samples. 

After analysing the data we were provided, the fold change value of the reference gene (ubi) was 1, indicating that only CDC42 and VegfR were upregulated.

## **Designing qPCR primers to test for heat shock proteins (HSP) 70 in *Brachidontes pharaonis* in the presence of heat stress**

This section focused on designing qPCR primers to detect heat shock proteins (HSP) 70 in *Brachidontes pharaonis* under heat stress. I used the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database to search for *Mytilus* HSP70 sequences, which were then aligned using CLUSTALW. The primer design was made using the Primer3 website.

The study anticipates that thermal stress will lead to a significant increase in HSP70 expression levels in *B. pharaonis*. This is due to the upregulation of HSP70, which plays a crucial role in protein folding, protein transport, and maintaining cellular homeostasis. The increase in HSP70 expression may exhibit a temporal pattern, with peak levels occurring shortly after the onset of thermal stress. The magnitude of the increase in HSP70 expression will depend on the severity and duration of the thermal stress.

The study will test HSP70 expression levels under various stress conditions, including thermal stress, pollution and contaminants, and combined stressors. I  will use any of these: GAPDH, 40S ribosomal protein S4, Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1, and 40S ribosomal protein S27 as my reference gene for normalization in qPCR analysis. This will provide comprehensive insights into the molecular defense mechanisms of *B. pharaonis* and how different stressors impact their ability to cope with environmental changes.

## **Analysis of Photo-survey Data**

This section contains the resulting analysis of data from the photo-survey of benthic biota across two transects of the Eastern Mediterranean continental shelf. The data was analyzed using CSV files, which contained details about each transect, site, depth, season, and transect ID. The analysis focused on algae coverage, which was analyzed with respect to site, season, and seafloor depth. ART ANOVA revealed significant effects of site and depth on algae coverage, but no significant difference was found between the two samplers. The analysis also examined the interaction between algae and Bryozoa, a taxonomic group, to reveal key ecological interactions and dynamics within the ecosystem. The Spearman correlation analysis revealed a strong and statistically significant negative correlation between algae and Bryozoa coverage, suggesting that Bryozoa coverage tends to decrease significantly as algae coverage increases. This relationship is crucial for ecological studies, environmental monitoring, and resource management, as it provides insights into the dynamics of the benthic community and helps in developing effective conservation strategies.

## **Molecular Network in GNPS**

I created a molecular network using Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS). I submitted a job to create a network, which took time to complete. After the job, I explored a molecular family, including neutral losses, using the "LibraryID" option. I also compared the spectra of two compounds and added them as figures.
