# **Designed qPCR primers for the detection of heat shock proteins (HSP) 70 in *Brachidontes pharaonis* in the presence of heat stress**

To design the forward and reverse primers for this purpose, I accessed the NCBI website and downloaded the FASTA sequences of mussel HSP70. I aligned these sequences (Figure 1A) to identify the conserved and variable regions, focusing on the conserved regions for primer design. Using Primer3, I generated the primers based on these conserved regions (Figure 1B).
