# Quantification of genes expression using quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR)

We were provided with data of genes expressed in urchins after treatment and quantified by qPCR to analyze. 

The Delta-Delta Ct (ΔΔCt) method or Livak was employed. This method is commonly used to analyze quantitative real-time PCR data to compare gene expression levels between different samples. When applying the ΔΔCt method, two critical assumptions including; 1. Efficiency of the PCR reaction and 2. Consistent reference gene expression must be met.

After the data analysis, it could be concluded that only CDC42 and VegfR were upregulated since the fold change value of the reference gene (ubi) was 1.
