# **Designing primers for *Endozoicomonas***

To design primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene for *Endozoicomonas*, I aligned sequences from four species using CLUSTALW to identify conserved regions. I used Primer3 for primer design and constructed a phylogenetic tree in MEGA 11, which showed that *Endozoicomonas gorgoniicola* is closely related to *Endozoicomonas numazuensis*.
