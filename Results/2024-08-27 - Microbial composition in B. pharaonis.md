# **Acute thermal stress changed the microbiome composition of B. pharaonis**

To conduct the study, adult *Brachidontes pharaonis* mussels were collected and acclimated in microcosm chambers, then exposed to acute thermal stress across 3 temperature gradients for 3 days. Afterward, gut samples were dissected for microbiome DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The data were analyzed using statistical and bioinformatics tools to assess microbial diversity and identified bacterial taxa with differential abundance across temperature treatments.

# **Results** 

After the experiment of exposing B. pharaonis to acute heat stress, revealing changes in the relative 
abundance of bacterial communities. Elevated temperature significantly increased Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, 
and Bacteroidota while decreasing Proteobacteria.
