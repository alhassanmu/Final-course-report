# **Acute thermal stress changed the microbiome composition of *B. pharaonis***

# **Methodology**
To conduct the study, adult *Brachidontes pharaonis* mussels were collected and acclimated in microcosm chambers before being exposed to acute thermal stress across three temperature gradients for three days. Gut samples were then dissected for microbiome DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The resulting data were analyzed using statistical and bioinformatics tools to assess microbial diversity and identify bacterial taxa with differential abundance across the temperature treatments.

The experimental flow is illustrated below:

# **Results** 

Following the experiment in which *B. pharaonis* was exposed to acute heat stress, notable shifts in the relative abundance of bacterial communities were observed. Elevated temperatures led to a significant increase in Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, and Bacteroidota, while Proteobacteria levels decreased.
