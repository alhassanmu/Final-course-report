# **Analysis of photo-survey data**

The data analyzed is from the photo-survey of benthic biota across two transects of the Eastern Mediterranean continental shelf by research from the Morris Khan Research Station and can be found on their website.

The ART ANOVA reveals significant effects of site and depth on algae coverage (Figure 1A and B).

There was no significant difference (*P-value* = 0.048) in algae coverage between the two samplers (Figure 2).

Furthermore, I explored the algae-bryozoa interaction using log-transformed data and Benjamini-Hochberg correction. The Spearman correlation analysis revealed a strong and statistically significant negative correlation between algae and Bryozoa coverage [r = âˆ’0.742, *P-value* = 0] (Figure 3).
