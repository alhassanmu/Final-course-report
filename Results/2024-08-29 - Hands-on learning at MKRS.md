We had a field trip to the Morris Kahn Marine Research Station (MKMRS) and was intended for hands-on learning of marine research methods. We engaged in activities such as identifying various marine intertidal organisms, primarily algae, snorkeling to depths of about 2 meters or more (optional), collecting marine samples for research, processing those samples, and analyzing the resulting data.

Using quadrats, we identified and counted intertidal marine organisms, with a focus on algae. We laid a 25-meter transect line and placed quadrats every 5 meters to count the number of algae present at each location (Figure 1A). The results showed that *Jania* was the most dominant in the intertidal zone, followed by *Padina*. *Laurencia* and *Sargassum* were the least abundant (Figure 1B).

We were trained on how to monitor/measure temperature at the sea. With this, we placed two (2) HOBOconnect devices, one  on the intertidal zone to record Sea Surface Temperature (SST), while the other was placed about 2 meters into the sea to record the Seawater Temperature (SWT). The temperatures recorded by the loggers are shown in Figure 2.

Samples of *Padina* were collected from two different locations with varying light intensities and transported to the lab for physiological assessment. They were prepared and the induction and quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence in the *Padina* samples using a PAM fluorometer as a proxy for photosynthesis was conducted (Figure 3).
